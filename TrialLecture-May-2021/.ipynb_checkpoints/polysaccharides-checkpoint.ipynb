    "# Polysaccharides\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to follow this lecture, basic knowledge of carbohydrates (e.g. from a subject like **TBT4102 Biochemistry 1**) is required. In preparation for this lecture, you can refresh your knowledge here https://courses.lumenlearning.com/ivytech-bio1-1/chapter/reading-types-of-carbohydrates/. Below, key concepts are briefly reviewed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polysaccharides (poly=many; saccharides=sugars) are polymers of monosaccharides. In nature, monosaccharides like glucose are bound together by enzymes, forming  sugar polymers, or polysaccharides. Polysaccharides may be branched or linear, charged or uncharged, and may be composed of one, two, or several different monosaccharides. The molecular weight of a polysaccharide may be on the order of 1000-100,000 Da (g/mol) depending on the monosaccharide residues. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='figure_07_12.jpg' width=400/>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on how the -OH on C5 attacks (red arrow) the C1 carbonyl group (from the top or from the bottom) during the sugar ring formation of e.g. glucose, two **anomers**, $\\alpha$ or $\\beta$, of the hemiacetal may be produced. As long as the hemiacetal is not part of a glycosidic bond, the reaction is reversible and an interconversion between $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ anomers occurs. In polysaccharides, the hemiacetal end is  called the **reducing end**.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='figure_07_06.jpg' width=400/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Two monosaccharides can be joined together via a **glycosidic bond** between an anomeric carbon and a hydroxyl carbon to form a disaccharide. Disacharides can be named by their anomeric form and linkage or a common name. For example, the disaccharide maltose is formed by joining two glucose units. The -OH (alcohol) attached to C4 of one glucose molecule (right) condenses with the  hemiacetal (anomeric carbon) of the other $\\alpha$-D-glucose molecule (left), with elimination of $H_{2}O$ and formation of a 1&rarr;4 glycosidic bond. The reversal of this reaction is hydrolysis: attack by $H_{2}O$ on the glycosidic bond.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='figure_07_10.jpg' width=400/>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Addition of more monosaccharides to the chain results in polysaccharides. In this notebook there are examples of four polysaccharides: amylose, dextran, cellulose and chitin. Information is included about their structural properties, as well as natural and industrial applications. Interactive 3D structural models are provided using Python code."

The helical structure allows for high compaction of the sugar chain, minimizing the space needed by the plant cell to store energy. When consumed by animals and humans, starch is broken down by enzymes ($\\alpha$-amylases).\n",
